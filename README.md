# Mapler

Currently built for Windows only. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/xreic/Mapler/releases). \
Mapler is a desktop program to help keep track of Maplestory dailies and weeklies. \
About 175 MB of disk usage, because you're basically installing another Chrome to run this.

## Features

- Per character tracking of daily and weekly tasks
  - Will work without having a character added
- Toggle which tasks are shown and hidden
- Ability to organize characters and tasks via drag-n-drop
- Automatic reset of tasks based on day of the week
- Ursus Golden Time indicator
